# Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict diseases from symptoms. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and can be used to predict the likelihood of different diseases based on the input symptoms.

# Dataset

The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of two CSV files:
- `Training.csv`: Contains the training data with symptoms and their corresponding diseases.
- `Testing.csv`: Contains the testing data for evaluating the model.

# Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need the following libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib` (if used for visualization)

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib

# Training
To train the disease prediction model, run the provided Python script:

```bash
python Disease_Prediction_Code_for_model_training.py
This script will:
Load the training and testing datasets.
Preprocess the data (e.g., handle missing values, drop unnecessary columns).
Train a machine learning model on the training data.
Evaluate the model on the testing data.

# Evaluation
The script evaluates the model using standard metrics and prints the results. You can modify the script to include additional evaluation metrics or techniques as needed.

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions or improvements, please create a pull request or open an issue.
